# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN 🤖

This project aims to predict customer churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The model classifies whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographic and transactional details. The project includes preprocessing, model training, and deployment via **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Streamlit Web Application

Check out the live demo of the churn prediction model here:

### Key Features:
- Real-time churn prediction based on user inputs
- Feature scaling and encoding integrated into the prediction pipeline
- User-friendly web interface
